abstract = {A theoretical framework for analyzing stochastic data from single-particle tracking in viscoelastic materials and under the influence of a trapping potential is presented. Starting from a generalized Langevin equation, we found analytical expressions for the two-time dynamics of a particle subjected to a harmonic potential. The mean-square displacement and the velocity autocorrelation function of the diffusing particle are given in terms of the time lag. In particular, we investigate the subdiffusive case. Using a power-law memory kernel, exact expressions for the mean-square displacement and the velocity autocorrelation function are obtained in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions and their derivatives. The behaviors for short-, intermediate-, and long-time lags are investigated in terms of the involved parameters. Finally, the validity of usual approximations is examined. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Berne1966,
abstract = {In this paper we develop a formalism for calculating the autocorrelation function of a dynamical variable in terms of a well-defined memory function. Guided by simple physical arguments, an ansatz is adopted for the functional form of the memory function. This ansatz asserts that the memory of dynamical coherence decays exponentially. It is found that: (a) Despite the monotonie exponential decay of the memory function, the autocorrelation function deduced can display negative regions in some circumstances and decay monotonically in other circumstances. (b) The form of the autocorrelation function deduced is identical with that obtained from two other very different analyses, suggesting that the major properties of the function are of general validity. (c) The computed linear momentum autocorrelation function and power spectrum for liquid Ar are in good agreement with the computer experiments of Rahman. (d) The computed dipolar autocorrelation function reproduces all the features of the experimentally determined autocorrelation function, though at present insufficient data are available to provide a quantitative test of the theory. (e) The ansatz used, although obviously not exact, is consistent with the theory of linear regression (Appendix B).},

@article{Baczewski2013,
abstract = {Generalized Langevin dynamics (GLD) arise in the modeling of a number of systems, ranging from structured fluids that exhibit a viscoelastic mechanical response, to biological systems, and other media that exhibit anomalous diffusive phenomena. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that include GLD in conjunction with external and/or pairwise forces require the development of numerical integrators that are efficient, stable, and have known convergence properties. In this article, we derive a family of extended variable integrators for the Generalized Langevin equation with a positive Prony series memory kernel. Using stability and error analysis, we identify a superlative choice of parameters and implement the corresponding numerical algorithm in the LAMMPS MD software package. Salient features of the algorithm include exact conservation of the first and second moments of the equilibrium velocity distribution in some important cases, stable behavior in the limit of conventional Langevin dynamics, and the use of a convolution-free formalism that obviates the need for explicit storage of the time history of particle velocities. Capability is demonstrated with respect to accuracy in numerous canonical examples, stability in certain limits, and an exemplary application in which the effect of a harmonic confining potential is mapped onto a memory kernel. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {We present efficient finite difference estimators for goal-oriented sensitivity indices with applications to the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). In particular, we apply these estimators to analyze an extended variable formulation of the GLE where other well known sensitivity analysis techniques such as the likelihood ratio method are not applicable to key parameters of interest. These easily implemented estimators are formed by coupling the nominal and perturbed dynamics appearing in the finite difference through a common driving noise or common random path. After developing a general framework for variance reduction via coupling, we demonstrate the optimality of the common random path coupling in the sense that it produces a minimal variance surrogate for the difference estimator relative to sampling dynamics driven by independent paths. In order to build intuition for the common random path coupling, we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed estimators for a comprehensive set of examples of interest in particle dynamics. These reduced variance difference estimators are also a useful tool for performing global sensitivity analysis and for investigating non-local perturbations of parameters, such as increasing the number of Prony modes active in an extended variable GLE.},

@article{Lysy2016,
abstract = {State-of-the-art techniques in passive particle-tracking microscopy provide high-resolution path trajectories of diverse foreign particles in biological fluids. For particles on the order of 1 $\mu$m diameter, these paths are generally inconsistent with simple Brownian motion. Yet, despite an abundance of data confirming these findings and their wide-ranging scientific implications, stochastic modeling of the complex particle motion has received comparatively little attention. Even among posited models, there is virtually no literature on likelihood-based inference, model comparisons, and other quantitative assessments. In this article, we develop a rigorous and computationally efficient Bayesian methodology to address this gap. We analyze two of the most prevalent candidate models for 30-sec paths of 1 $\mu$m diameter tracer particles in human lung mucus: fractional Brownian motion (fBM) and a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) consistent with viscoelastic theory. Our model comparisons distinctly favor GLE over fBM, with the former describing the data remarkably well up to the timescales for which we have reliable information.
